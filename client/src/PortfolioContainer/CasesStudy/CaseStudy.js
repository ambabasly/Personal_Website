                myFlix is a web application developed with the MERN/MEAN stack

                The objective of the project was to create an interactive and
                entertaining web application for movie lovers who enjoy reading
                information about different movies. As with its famous
                counterpart - the Internet Movie Database/IMDb - this
                application aimed to enable users to create an account and
                perform a certain number of actions, apart from searching movie
                titles. Read detailed information about a movie, a director, or
                a movie genre, Add a movie to a favorites list, and Modify their
                account information (personal information, favorite movies).

                <strong>Development</strong>
              </h2>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The project was developed in 3 distinct phases. The first phase
                involved creating the backend component of the application, that
                is, the part of the application which deals with communicating
                with the server and the database for handling tasks such as
                logging in and accessing the database (viewing, modifying,
                deleting data), while the other 2 part were being created using
                React.js for the frontend and again using Angular for the same
                frontend where users can interact and perform every request.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-justify">
              <strong>Backend Objective:</strong> The server side of the myFlix
              application should ensure that users have access to information
              about different movies, that their requests can be processed and
              that all necessary data can be stored.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              A database needed to be created for storing data and, to this end,
              MongoDB was chosen. MongoDB is a no-SQL database, meaning that it
              provides a less rigid structure for creating records. This
              provides flexibility in terms of change in the schema. Unlike
              traditional RDBMS systems, where you need to alter the structure
              of the table if you need a change in the data schema, MongoDB dont
              need you to alter the structure to make such changes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              And this logic for interacting with the database was written using
              Node.js, which is a running environment for executing Javascript
              on the server-side. Any interaction with the database from the
              userâ€™s side would have to be translated as a server request
              handled in the back-end component by Node.js. Before proceeding to
              develop the front-end component, all the possible user-generated
              requests were being tested using the Postman tool, which provides
              the possibility to perform CRUD requests.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
              <strong>Frontend Objective:</strong> The client side will create
              the user interface through which users will make requests to and
              receive responses from the server side. A user can access
              information on movies, directors, genres, and create a profile to
              save data about his or her favorite movies, and offcourse delete a
              profile if need be.

                (and React Redux) worked. Including all the features and Angular
                materials, the learning process and the main features, the whole
